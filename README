# Loan prediction Project

Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict loan outcomes based on customer demographics and financial details. The model leverages preprocessing pipelines, cross-validation, and an optimized XGBoost classifier for robust and reliable predictions.

Key Features
	•	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Numeric features are imputed using the mean and standardized.
	•	Categorical features are imputed with the most frequent value and one-hot encoded.
	•	ColumnTransformer is used to combine preprocessing pipelines.
	•	Cross-Validation:
	•	Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation is used to ensure balanced class distributions across folds.
	•	Each fold is trained and evaluated independently to calculate AUC scores.
	•	Modeling:
	•	The primary model is an XGBoost Classifier with hyperparameters optimized using Optuna.
	•	Predictions are made on both validation and test datasets.
	•	Evaluation:
	•	The model performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve UC metric.
	•	Final results include mean and standard deviation of AUC across folds.

Libraries Used

The project is implemented using Python with the following libraries:
	•	Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
	•	Preprocessing: scikit-learn (Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, StandardScaler, SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder)
	•	Modeling: xgboost (XGBClassifier)
	•	Cross-Validation & Evaluation: scikit-learn (StratifiedKFold, roc_auc_score)
	•	Optimization: optuna
	•	Utilities: gc

File Structure
	•	loan_prediction.ipynb: The main notebook containing all code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

How to Run the Project
	1.	Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Use the following command to install missing dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost optuna


	2.	Prepare the Data:
	•	Load your training and test datasets into the notebook.
	•	Ensure the dataset includes the following features:
	•	Numeric Features: person_age, person_income, loan_amnt
	•	Categorical Features: person_home_ownership, loan_intent, loan_grade
	3.	Run the Notebook:
	•	Open the loan_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
	•	Execute the cells step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
	4.	Results:
	•	AUC scores for each fold will be printed during cross-validation.
	•	Final mean and standard deviation of AUC are displayed at the end.

Key Results
	•	The model achieved high AUC scores across all validation folds, ensuring robust performance on unseen data.
	•	The use of cross-validation mitigates overfitting and ensures generalizability.

Future Improvements
	•	Incorporate additional feature engineering to improve predictive power.
	•	Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost).
	•	Evaluate feature importance to refine input features further.
